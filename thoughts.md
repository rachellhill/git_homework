1. Googlin' is no joke! I have googled something everyday since I started Mod0 and understand the important use of it in Turing's everyday activities
2. The tip "start your prework right away" has helped me not only feel like I am progressing in the right direction, but it's helped me stay on top of lessons and actively apply what I learn in the sessions directly to the prework. I also feel less stressed than procrastinating.
3. A strategy I would like to try out is Pseudocode for each project I encounter at Turing. It seems like this is a very helpful strategy when it comes to interviewing and going through the technical parts of these interviews.
4. Breaking down problems is a strategy I would like to work on that is similar to pseudo code but when I get more deep into code, it's important to understand each parts of the problem to guide me in the right direction of fixing something that's broke.
